        <h3>What is GNS3</h3>
        <p>
            GNS3 is a software that emulate real Networks Operating Systems into a friendly environment, 
            It is used for setting up network devices such as Routers, Switches, Firewalls, Virtual PCs, and so on. <br>
            The network devices will be running on a virtual server, the network devices will run as IOS, which is 
            Interconnection Operating System running on the server and GNS3 will be like a simulator and will give you 
            access to the CLI (Command Line Interface) of these network devices by putty or any remote connection softwares. <br>

        <h3>What is DNS</h3>
        <p>
            It is short for Domain Name System, you make use of DNS every day; when you want to browse the internet 
            let's say youtube, and you type on the browser youtube.com, actually Youtube web server doesn't understand the name 
            youtube.com, when you communicate with youtube you communicate with it with IP address, so let's say that 
            IP addresses is the language of the web server (it is actually how you communicate with anything in any network), and Youtube.com is 
            our human language, we could type the address of youtube to connect to it, but you can't remember every IP address of all 
            of your favorite websites. <br>
            So DNS will translate Youtube.com into IP address like 77.12.66.20 so Youtube web server could understand. A DNS server is responsible of 
            resolving any DNS message which is called query and it's a message like this:"Hey DNS server what is the IP address of 
            Youbue.com?", and the DNS server will have a table that consists of records, there are (A Records, which for IPv4) and (AAAA Records, which 
            are for IPv6), and each record has an IP address for particular name, and when the DNS server is given a name 
            it will reply with the IP address for that name from it's records table.<br>

        <h3>What is DHCP</h3>
        <p>
            In network prespective we refer to DNS and DHCP as IP services, they are services that are literaly optional but required!, 
            that might seem stupid but the idea is you can not have them, but you must have them in your network. Let me explain, 
            you as a client you want to browse the Internet or any network you must have two addresses, a physical MAC address that 
            is burned with the device it's unique globally and can't be changed (shouldn't be changed), and IP address is what you must have 
            in order to be able to communicate with any other node or client connected to your network or the Internet, So let's say you are 
            in a caffe you need to connect to the Wireless Access Point (WI-FI) in normal you will be concerned about the Authentication Key (PSK), 
            or any authentication method, but without DHCP you have to ask for the IP address and assigned it yourself, it's not hard but, if you went home 
            and wanted to connect to another network you again need to know what IP address is available what is the DNS server address, the default gateway,
            and even then the IP address might be used by someone else. <br> 
            And here comes the best IP sersvice ever!, DHCP is short for Domain Host Configuration Protocol, and it is the server 
            that gives you all the address information, such as what address you should use, the gateway of your network and even the DNS server 
            address, The IP addresses will be configured on a pool, this pool will contain a range of IP addresses for hosts to get so 
            they will be able to communicate with others in the network, and the gateway and DNS server address will be 
            consistent for all hosts.<br>
            There is much more information about DNS and DHCP if you are intersted you can do a google search or seach on youtube.

        <h3>Virtual Machines and Virtualization</h3>
        <p>
            Virtualization is a feature that let you run actual Machines on your physical Machine, they aren't actual machines they 
            are virtual but they will take allocation of actual space and use from your memory and CPU, so they are virtual machines 
            with Operating Systems run over the Host Operating System which is the actual PC.<br>
            The Operating System Kali Linux is Linux distrobution made by Offensive Security and it's made for penetration testing, 
            with a strong penetration tools. <br>
            Windows is an Operating System which is made for personal uses and it's the most used OS in now days; because it is easy to 
            use and have security features.

        <h3>ARP / ARP Spoofing</h3>
        <p>
            ARP is short for Address Resolution Protocol, and it is the protocol that carry the IP address of 
            a MAC address on layer 2, when you want to send traffic in your network the traffic will be tagged 
            with your MAC address so you actually communicate with others with your MAC address, but to reach others 
            you need to have IP address so ARP is a protocol that gives you the MAC address of an IP address and 
            it keeps this information in an ARP table or ARP cache; so when you want to  communicate to every 
            one it will look at the ARP table and if it didn't find the address, it will send a request message saying:"
            what MAC address has this IP address" and the device with that IP address will reply back with it's 
            MAC address.<br>
            ARP Spoofing (ARP Poisonning) is when you poison the ARP table, by sending a gratiutous ARP message and what that is, 
            you basically send an ARP reply message without receiving an ARP request message, so let's say PC1 want to 
            communicate with PC2 PC1 has IP address 10.0.0.1, and PC2 has IP address 10.0.0.2, so PC1 will ask PC2 
            what is your MAC address and PC2 will respond my MAC is PC2M.AC00.0000 and PC1 will add PC2 MAC address to it's 
            table and PC2 will do the same after sending the reply, after the ARP table is updated for PC1 and PC2, 
            an attacker will come and send a message to PC1 saying:"PC2 MAC address is ATTA.CKER.MAC0" which is the attacker MAC 
            address and PC1 will change the MAC address of PC2 to the attacker's MAC address lined up with PC2 IP address.<br>
            So now any time PC1 want to send a message to PC2 10.0.0.2, the message will come to the attacker which PC1 thinks it is PC2 
            and the attacker can do anything with the messages, sniff information, change the information, crack some passwords it can 
            do anything, even decide wether or not it will forward the traffice to the destination.<br>
        </p>

        <h3>DNS Spoofing</h3>
        <p>
            DNS spoofing is when an attacker wait for the victim to send a DNS query message and reply to it 
            with a resolving of another IP address not the IP address the victim was hoping for, so let's say PC1 
            want to access facebook.com before communicating with the gateway to access the website it will ask for 
            the IP address of the name facebook.com, and it will do that by sending a DNS query message which says:"
            hey DNS server, what is the IP address of facebook.com", and now it sent the message, so here comes the attacker 
            and intercepts the message, so the message don't go to the DNS server, and the attacker will say to PC1:"
            Hey PC1, here is your DNS server, the IP address of facebook.com is 192.168.1.3" and that is not the IP address 
            of facebook.com, that IP address can anything the attacker want; a malicious web page, a banner graber, a tracker 
            phishing web page or anythin, so after PC1 sent the request message and the attacker responded to him 
            the victim will go to the IP address 192.168.1.3 instead of the actuall IP address of facebook.com.<br>
            This is common in phishing attacks which the attacker creates a landing page that looks like the desired web page by 
            the victim so the victim will think he is in the right web page, and it can be a facebook phishing web page 
            and when the victim tries to log in, all the credintials will go to the attacker.<br>

            Sorry if I didn't explain these topics clearly, I tried to explain them as strongly as possible based 
            on my understanding of the topics, and I'm not an expert myself, and certainly not an expert in explaining stuff, 
            you can find much better explaining on the internet, and I just hope you enjoyed this Document!.<br>
